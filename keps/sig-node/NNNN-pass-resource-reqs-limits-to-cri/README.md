## Summary

kubelet does not provide complete information about the container
`resources` specification (`requires` and `limits`) to CRI. However, we have
identified various use cases where detailed knowledge of all the resources can
be utilized in container runtimes for more optimal resource allocation to
improve application performance and reduce cross-application interference.

This KEP proposes a CRI API extension for disclosing container
`resources` information to container runtimes.

## Motivation

Currently, kubelet is (only) responsible for selecting CPUs and memories to be
allocated for a container which is achieved by setting up
`LinuxContainerResources`/`WindowsContainerResources` in `CreateContainer` and
`UpdateContainerResources` requests. And, even there the original details of
the resource spec is lost. Non-native resources such as extended resources and
the device plugin resources are not visible to container runtimes at all.

However, VM-based runtimes such as
[Kata containers](https://katacontainers.io/),
platform-optimized container runtimes,
[OCI hooks](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/master/config.md),
[runC](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) wrappers,
[NRI](https://github.com/containerd/nri) plugins,
down to programs running in containers would benefit on getting full
resource information. Extending the CRI API in a backwards-compatible way
provides a holistic view of the resource usage of containers to all these
components, paving the way for improved resource allocation without breaking
any existing use cases.

This KEP eases the pressure of handling resource allocations on exotic hardware
configuration in kubelet by allowing resource allocation to happen in the
container runtime instead.

### Goals

- make container resource spec transparently visible on CRI level
- enable runtime-level optimization of resource allocation

### Non-Goals

- change/optimize kubelet resource handling
- change existing behavior of CRI

## Proposal

### User Stories

<!--
Detail the things that people will be able to do if this KEP is implemented.
Include as much detail as possible so that people can understand the "how" of
the system. The goal here is to make this feel real for users without getting
bogged down.
-->

#### Story 1

As a VM-based container runtime developer, I want to allocate/expose
enough RAM, hugepages, GPU memory, Intel SGX EPC memory sections and
other resources for the VM to ensure that all containers in the pod
are guaranteed to get the resources they require.

#### Story 2

As a platform-optimized CRI runtime developer, I want to know detailed
container resource requests of all resources handled by kubelet to be
able to make optimal, platform specific, resource allocations. Some of
the resources may be handled outside cgroups and be container runtime
specific details.

#### Story 3

As a cluster administrator, I want to install an OCI hook/runc
wrapper/NRI plugin that does customized resource handling.

### ResourceConfig

We propose that kubelet discloses full `resources` information to CRIs
in *new* `ResourceConfig` field (of type `PodResourceConfig`). The
field is added to *existing* `PodSandboxConfig`, `ContainerConfig` and
`UpdateContainerResourcesRequest` structures. It contains the
information of resource requests of all containers in a pod.

The structure of `PodResourceConfig`:

```protobuf
 import "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/api/resource/generated.proto";
 
 message PodSandboxConfig {
 
 ...
 
     map<string, string> annotations = 7;
     // Optional configurations specific to Linux hosts.
     LinuxPodSandboxConfig linux = 8;
+
+    // Kubernetes resource spec of the containers in the pod
+    PodResourceConfig pod_resources = 9;
 }
 
 message ContainerConfig {
 
 ...
 
     // Configuration specific to Linux containers.
     LinuxContainerConfig linux = 15;
     // Configuration specific to Windows containers.
     WindowsContainerConfig windows = 16;
+
+    // Kubernetes resource spec of the container
+    ContainerResourceConfig container_resources = 17;
 }
 
 message UpdateContainerResourcesRequest {
     // ID of the container to update.
     string container_id = 1;
     // Resource configuration specific to Linux containers.
     LinuxContainerResources linux = 2;
     // Resource configuration specific to Windows containers.
     WindowsContainerResources windows = 3;
     // Unstructured key-value map holding arbitrary additional information for
     // container resources updating. This can be used for specifying experimental
     // resources to update or other options to use when updating the container.
     map<string, string> annotations = 4;
+
+    // Kubernetes resource spec of the container
+    ContainerResourceConfig container_resources = 5;
 }
 
+message PodResourceConfig {
+    map<string, ContainerResourceConfig> init_containers = 1;
+    map<string, ContainerResourceConfig> containers = 2;
+}

+message ContainerResourceConfig {
+    // Requests and limits hold corresponding container resources data.
+    map<string, k8s.io.apimachinery.pkg.api.resource.Quantity> requests = 1;
+    map<string, k8s.io.apimachinery.pkg.api.resource.Quantity> limits = 2;
+}
```

Example: Pod specification:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
...
spec:
  containers:
    - name: db
      ...
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 1900m
          memory: 10G
        limits:
          cpu: 1900m
          memory: 10G
    - name: db-sync-with-hw-accel
      ...
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 100M
          intel.com/qat: 2
        limits:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 100M
          intel.com/qat: 2
```

Kubelet constructs `ResourceConfig`, sketched here in `yaml` format:
```yaml
PodResourceConfig:
  containers:
    db
      requests:
        cpu: 1900m
        memory: 10G
      limits:
       cpu: 1900m
       memory: 10G
    db-sync-with-hw-accel
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 100M
        intel.com/qat: 2
      limits:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 100M
        intel.com/qat: 2
```

When the CRI layer gets this information, it can make sure that the
requested CPU, memory and `intel.com/qat` resources are reserved to
containers so that accesses between hardware resources are as
efficient as possible on the underlying hardware.

## Design Details

### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Consider the following in developing a test plan for this enhancement:
- Will there be e2e and integration tests, in addition to unit tests?
- How will it be tested in isolation vs with other components?

No need to outline all of the test cases, just the general strategy. Anything
that would count as tricky in the implementation, and anything particularly
challenging to test, should be called out.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations). Please adhere to the [Kubernetes testing guidelines][testing-guidelines]
when drafting this test plan.

[testing-guidelines]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md
-->

### Graduation Criteria

* **N/A**

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Define graduation milestones.

These may be defined in terms of API maturity, or as something else. The KEP
should keep this high-level with a focus on what signals will be looked at to
determine graduation.

Consider the following in developing the graduation criteria for this enhancement:
- [Maturity levels (`alpha`, `beta`, `stable`)][maturity-levels]
- [Deprecation policy][deprecation-policy]

Clearly define what graduation means by either linking to the [API doc
definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning)
or by redefining what graduation means.

In general we try to use the same stages (alpha, beta, GA), regardless of how the
functionality is accessed.

[maturity-levels]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions
[deprecation-policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/

Below are some examples to consider, in addition to the aforementioned [maturity levels][maturity-levels].

#### Alpha -> Beta Graduation

- Gather feedback from developers and surveys
- Complete features A, B, C
- Tests are in Testgrid and linked in KEP

#### Beta -> GA Graduation

- N examples of real-world usage
- N installs
- More rigorous forms of testingâ€”e.g., downgrade tests and scalability tests
- Allowing time for feedback

**Note:** Generally we also wait at least two releases between beta and
GA/stable, because there's no opportunity for user feedback, or even bug reports,
in back-to-back releases.

#### Removing a Deprecated Flag

- Announce deprecation and support policy of the existing flag
- Two versions passed since introducing the functionality that deprecates the flag (to address version skew)
- Address feedback on usage/changed behavior, provided on GitHub issues
- Deprecate the flag

**For non-optional features moving to GA, the graduation criteria must include
[conformance tests].**

[conformance tests]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/conformance-tests.md
-->

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this
enhancement:
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to maintain previous behavior?
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to make use of the enhancement?
-->

### Version Skew Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component handle version skew with other
components? What are the guarantees? Make sure this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing a version skew strategy for this
enhancement:
- Does this enhancement involve coordinating behavior in the control plane and
  in the kubelet? How does an n-2 kubelet without this feature available behave
  when this feature is used?
- Will any other components on the node change? For example, changes to CSI,
  CRI or CNI may require updating that component before the kubelet.
-->

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

<!--

Production readiness reviews are intended to ensure that features merging into
Kubernetes are observable, scalable and supportable; can be safely operated in
production environments, and can be disabled or rolled back in the event they
cause increased failures in production. See more in the PRR KEP at
https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-architecture/20190731-production-readiness-review-process.md.

The production readiness review questionnaire must be completed for features in
v1.19 or later, but is non-blocking at this time. That is, approval is not
required in order to be in the release.

In some cases, the questions below should also have answers in `kep.yaml`. This
is to enable automation to verify the presence of the review, and to reduce review
burden and latency.

The KEP must have a approver from the
[`prod-readiness-approvers`](http://git.k8s.io/enhancements/OWNERS_ALIASES)
team. Please reach out on the
[#prod-readiness](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CPNHUMN74) channel if
you need any help or guidance.

-->

<!--
### Feature Enablement and Rollback

_This section must be completed when targeting alpha to a release._

* **How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?**
  - [ ] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
    - Feature gate name:
    - Components depending on the feature gate:
  - [ ] Other
    - Describe the mechanism:
    - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime of the control
      plane?
    - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime or reprovisioning
      of a node? (Do not assume `Dynamic Kubelet Config` feature is enabled).

* **Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?**
  Any change of default behavior may be surprising to users or break existing
  automations, so be extremely careful here.

* **Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back
  the enablement)?**
  Also set `disable-supported` to `true` or `false` in `kep.yaml`.
  Describe the consequences on existing workloads (e.g., if this is a runtime
  feature, can it break the existing applications?).

* **What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?**

* **Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?**
  The e2e framework does not currently support enabling or disabling feature
  gates. However, unit tests in each component dealing with managing data, created
  with and without the feature, are necessary. At the very least, think about
  conversion tests if API types are being modified.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

* **How can a rollout fail? Can it impact already running workloads?**
  Try to be as paranoid as possible - e.g., what if some components will restart
   mid-rollout?

* **What specific metrics should inform a rollback?**

* **Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?**
  Describe manual testing that was done and the outcomes.
  Longer term, we may want to require automated upgrade/rollback tests, but we
  are missing a bunch of machinery and tooling and can't do that now.

* **Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs,
fields of API types, flags, etc.?**
  Even if applying deprecation policies, they may still surprise some users.

### Monitoring Requirements

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

* **How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?**
  Ideally, this should be a metric. Operations against the Kubernetes API (e.g.,
  checking if there are objects with field X set) may be a last resort. Avoid
  logs or events for this purpose.

* **What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine
the health of the service?**
  - [ ] Metrics
    - Metric name:
    - [Optional] Aggregation method:
    - Components exposing the metric:
  - [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
    - Details:

* **What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the above SLIs?**
  At a high level, this usually will be in the form of "high percentile of SLI
  per day <= X". It's impossible to provide comprehensive guidance, but at the very
  high level (needs more precise definitions) those may be things like:
  - per-day percentage of API calls finishing with 5XX errors <= 1%
  - 99% percentile over day of absolute value from (job creation time minus expected
    job creation time) for cron job <= 10%
  - 99,9% of /health requests per day finish with 200 code

* **Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability
of this feature?**
  Describe the metrics themselves and the reasons why they weren't added (e.g., cost,
  implementation difficulties, etc.).

### Dependencies

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

* **Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?**
  Think about both cluster-level services (e.g. metrics-server) as well
  as node-level agents (e.g. specific version of CRI). Focus on external or
  optional services that are needed. For example, if this feature depends on
  a cloud provider API, or upon an external software-defined storage or network
  control plane.

  For each of these, fill in the followingâ€”thinking about running existing user workloads
  and creating new ones, as well as about cluster-level services (e.g. DNS):
  - [Dependency name]
    - Usage description:
      - Impact of its outage on the feature:
      - Impact of its degraded performance or high-error rates on the feature:


### Scalability

_For alpha, this section is encouraged: reviewers should consider these questions
and attempt to answer them._

_For beta, this section is required: reviewers must answer these questions._

_For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field._

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?**
  Describe them, providing:
  - API call type (e.g. PATCH pods)
  - estimated throughput
  - originating component(s) (e.g. Kubelet, Feature-X-controller)
  focusing mostly on:
  - components listing and/or watching resources they didn't before
  - API calls that may be triggered by changes of some Kubernetes resources
    (e.g. update of object X triggers new updates of object Y)
  - periodic API calls to reconcile state (e.g. periodic fetching state,
    heartbeats, leader election, etc.)

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?**
  Describe them, providing:
  - API type
  - Supported number of objects per cluster
  - Supported number of objects per namespace (for namespace-scoped objects)

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud
provider?**

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of
the existing API objects?**
  Describe them, providing:
  - API type(s):
  - Estimated increase in size: (e.g., new annotation of size 32B)
  - Estimated amount of new objects: (e.g., new Object X for every existing Pod)

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any
operations covered by [existing SLIs/SLOs]?**
  Think about adding additional work or introducing new steps in between
  (e.g. need to do X to start a container), etc. Please describe the details.

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of
resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?**
  Things to keep in mind include: additional in-memory state, additional
  non-trivial computations, excessive access to disks (including increased log
  volume), significant amount of data sent and/or received over network, etc.
  This through this both in small and large cases, again with respect to the
  [supported limits].

### Troubleshooting

The Troubleshooting section currently serves the `Playbook` role. We may consider
splitting it into a dedicated `Playbook` document (potentially with some monitoring
details). For now, we leave it here.

_This section must be completed when targeting beta graduation to a release._

* **How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?**

* **What are other known failure modes?**
  For each of them, fill in the following information by copying the below template:
  - [Failure mode brief description]
    - Detection: How can it be detected via metrics? Stated another way:
      how can an operator troubleshoot without logging into a master or worker node?
    - Mitigations: What can be done to stop the bleeding, especially for already
      running user workloads?
    - Diagnostics: What are the useful log messages and their required logging
      levels that could help debug the issue?
      Not required until feature graduated to beta.
    - Testing: Are there any tests for failure mode? If not, describe why.

* **What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?**

[supported limits]: https://git.k8s.io/community//sig-scalability/configs-and-limits/thresholds.md
[existing SLIs/SLOs]: https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-scalability/slos/slos.md#kubernetes-slisslos

-->
## Implementation History

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a KEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this KEP _not_ be implemented?
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

## Infrastructure Needed (Optional)

<!--
Use this section if you need things from the project/SIG. Examples include a
new subproject, repos requested, or GitHub details. Listing these here allows a
SIG to get the process for these resources started right away.
-->
